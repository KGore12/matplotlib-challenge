## Background 
You've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

## Analysis

Evaluation of an animal study on the effects of different Drug Regimens for squamous cell carcinoma. The study involved 249 mice over the course of 45 days treated with different Drug Regimens. The tumor volume for each mouse was measured every 5 days over the course of those 45 days. This evaluation focuses on the performance of the drug Capomulin vs three other drug regimens (Ramicane, Ceftamin and Infubinol).

Utilized Jupyter notebook, pandas and matplotlib in this evaluation.

Utilized boxplots and line graphs for visualization of the four drugs effect on tumor volume over the course of 45 days.

The top three final observations of the study are outlined under the heading of the Jupyter notebook.
