# Pymaceutical - matplotlib homework

## Background 
You've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

## Final 3 Observations 
(1)  Gender of the mice did not appear to have an impace on the effectiveness of the drug treatments.  This was ascertained by evaluating the ratio of male to female mice and comparing to the size of the tumors. 

(2)  Of the 4 treatments analyzed, the average tumor volume increased over time with the drugs Ceftamin and Infubinol.

(3)  Capomulin showed the strong results in improving tumor volume but Ramicane was the best for the timeframe in the data. 




## Tools
Used Jupyter notebook, pandas and matplotlib for analysis.

Visualizations included bar graphs, line graphs, box plots, scatter plots.
